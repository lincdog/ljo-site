# Science and the public in the COVID-19 pandemic

During the past six months of global pandemic, there is no doubt that science and scientists have taken centerstage in both positive and negative lights. An explosion of research into the virus has dominated the journals and made it imperfectly into the headlines of major news outlets. Groups around the world have sprung into action to develop a vaccine with heroic speed and dedication. Politicians have complied to various degrees with the suggestions of scientists on public health policy. But a large section of the population has taken issue with some of the guidelines issued by government agencies and with the evolving scientific understanding of the virus and its disease. 

One set of causes is the politicization of scientific findings and the evolution of conspiracy-driven distrust of authority figures, especially those perceived to personally or through their institution follow a different political ideology than you. This is a complicated topic, and I don't really want to focus on this set of causes for the poor compliance with public health measures in America. I would instead like to talk about the perhaps less partisan collective perception of scientific research. I speak as someone educated in the public schools of suburban Massachusetts, an area known for good public schools. Yet I still find many misconceptions that I need to unlearn during my training in scientific research. 

First of all, what is scientific research? In my view, it is:
* a large-scale mechanism and a way of approaching reality that seeks iterative improvement of the human race's understanding of itself and the world around it
* an imperfect and collective optimization effort that on an ensemble level finds solutions for problems, some of which will contribute to reducing human suffering
Similar to biology itself, and many human institutions, research is a complex, multiscale system. Humans, not unemotional robots, are the atoms, and families, friends, research groups, departments, universities, companies, cities, countries are all relevant levels of organization, off the top of my head. The actions taken by any few individuals at any level may not reflect the ensemble goals of the institution. Humans make mistakes, and leaders of institutions make mistakes, especially when necessarily operating on limited information. 

It should not be surprising or suspicious that scientific research doesn't always get it right the first time. A common criticism or dismissal of scientific advice during the pandemic has cited the seemingly ever-changing nature of the government's or scientists' recommendations. To be fair, I think our agencies could have done a better job of managing their messaging in the early stages of the pandemic. I also think journalists need to listen to scientists more, and stop publishing sensational headlines, *especially* based on non-peer-reviewed preprints. 

However, that consensus and discussion about the virus and its effects is changing simply means that *science is happening*. On any topic studied by multiple groups, differences in interpretation and scientific opinion **will** occur. **This is a good thing**. Reality is **complicated**, and just like philosophers have argued and will continue to argue about complicated issues of human experience, scientists have argued and will continue to argue about the relative importance and validity of different pieces of scientific data and their interpretation. This is especially true when a field is exploding with new results: the urgent need for knowledge created by the pandemic restricts the time people have to think deeply and broadly about the results. I tend to think this rush may decrease the value of each individual result, but the aggregate of research will tend toward the truth still. Even now, and in the coming months and years, we will see consolidation of some of the interpretations as more experiments and analysis emerge. 

----------

What I described above is what I have learned in my first few years of grad school; it was not what I learned in all my years of education up to this time. I feel that science education is presented too much as "facts" that are **not** open for interpretation and exist on a pedestal above things like the humanities. It is certainly true that a great deal of knowledge can be treated like it were fact, as it has gone unchallenged for many years and forms a foundation for a field. But I think it's important to teach some perspective that those "facts" were not always settled and were often hotly debated and doubted in their time.
