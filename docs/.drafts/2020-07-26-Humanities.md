# On the relative "rigor" of the humanities versus science

One generally held perception is that the humanities - in particular sociology, philosophy, political science economics and *maybe* psychology - are less "rigorous" than the sciences that study the "natural world" - physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, medicine, etc. In the term "*hard* science" is embedded the idea that these latter fields use more solid evidence, more quantitative methods, more rigorous logic. On the other hand, the humanities are seen as more subjective: philosophers and political thinkers disagree wildly on fundamental issues, and this is seen as normal because of their great complexity.

The name "humanities" is appropriate here: the fields I listed generally focus on characterizing, understanding and prescribing *human* institutions, perceptions and actions. Biology and neuroscience of course also seek to understand humans, but benefit from the conservation of certain features between humans and other life forms that are easier to study. The humanities focus on aspects that are more or less *uniquely* human. 

As they are uniquely human, the problems studied in these fields cannot make use of simpler, more tractable experimental models. Also, many of them have unclear boundaries, scales and actors, so it is hard to reduce them into smaller, simpler subproblems. Lacking model systems or easily-identifiable reductions poses serious problems. In biology, experiments that would be unethical or impractical to run on humans make use of other mammals that share many traits with us, like monkeys or mice. Depending on how conserved traits of interest are, simpler organisms still can be employed to great success. Also, we have found "subproblems" in the form of simpler "parts" of a whole animal or human. We can grow human cells indefinitely in a dish, and even create 3D structured organ-like and embryo-like assemblies. Again, these simpler and more tractable systems allow one to perform causal experiments while conserving certain features of the original system. 

Unlike the physical sciences, one cannot really propose realistic "experiments" to run to determine the best system of government or economics for given initial conditions, or to determine objectively the nature of conscious experience. Only computer simulations, which must make assumptions based on current knowledge, are possible.
